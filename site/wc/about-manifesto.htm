					<h2 class="f-text__heading">Why</h2>
					<p class="f-text__text">
				  	Our society is developed by popular movements and their struggles.
					Throughout history, progressive steps for humanity has been led by a critical mass of people organized within movements.

					<p class="f-text__text">
					When the political system fails to reform, change, and solve the issues of humanity, it is not an error or a failure.
					The 'raison d'etre' is not to innovate, change or represent.
					The institutions, the goverments and the capitalist class aims to preserve current power structures, and in that sense it is doing a really good job.
					
					<p class="f-text__text">
					We think, we need to organise solidarity and start supporting the movements who have the ability to create real change.

					<h2 class="f-text__heading">Who</h2>

					<p class="f-text__text">

					This site is meant to be a useful tool for progressive movements.<br>
 					A tool for the full variety of groups, networks, tactics and ways of organizing, across borders and cultures.

					<p class="f-text__text">
					Everyone seeking progressive change will approach the tactics and solutions to accomplish their goals in their own manner. We need a platform that leverages this factor as a strength - not a reason for disunity and 'intraclass' warfare.

					<h2 class="f-text__heading">How</h2>
					<p class="f-text__text">
							In order to create and sustain progressive change,
							we should shift our focus away from the people in power and instead support
						 	the movements with revolutionary potential.

					<p class="f-text__text">
							We need mutual aid, mutual support and realised solidarity. We need accomplishes and alliances, we need cooperation and unity, we need creativity and multi-tactical diversity. We need to fund each other directly, not through handouts and charity from third party actors.

					<p class="f-text__text">
							With the internet, we have become part of each othersâ€™ struggles. Now we need to take advantage of this infrastructure and explore its revolutionary potential.

					<p class="f-text__text">
							We want to encourage, inspire, empower, support, include, exchange and work together within the movements, fighting for a world beyond oppression and unequally distributed rights, wealth and power.

					<p class="f-text__text">
							We want to facilitate and escalate the work of the social movements by connecting struggles through crowdfunding and crowdsourcing.
