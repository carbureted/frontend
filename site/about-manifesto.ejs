					<p class="f-text__text">
				  	Our society is created and developed by popular movements and their struggles.
					Throughout history, progressive steps for humanity has been led by a critical mass of people creating movements.
					When the political system fails to reform, change, and solve the issues of humanity, it is not an error or a failure.
					The political system is not designed to innovate, change or even represent.
					It is designed to preserve current power structures, and in that sense it is doing a really good job.
					In order to seize rights, power and influence, we need to organise solidarity and start supporting, not the people in power, but the movements who actually have the ability to create real change.
					Rights and liberties are not given to us. They are fought for and taken.

					<h2 class="f-text__heading">How</h2>

					<p class="f-text__text">
							In order to create and sustain progressive change,
							we should shift our focus away from the people in power and instead support
						 	the movements with revolutionary potential.
							We need mutual aid, -support and realised solidarity.
							We need to fund each other directly, not through handouts and charity from third party actors.

							The structure is already in place: Through the internet we become part of each othersâ€™ struggles
							by sharing and showing support, now we need to take advantage of this infrastructure and use it
							to its full potential.

							Everyone seeking progressive change will approach the tactics and solutions to accomplish this differently.
							All struggles vary in methods, input and output depending on where it takes place and the people carrying it out.
							We need a platform that uses this factor as a strength.

							We want to facilitate and escalate the work of the social movements by connecting people and struggles

							<p>In other words, we want to exchange symbolic solidarity into direct action.</p>
